# PWDK_DataAnalysis_SupermarketCustomer
A retail company (supermarket) records the shopping activities of its customers in the last 2 years. The supermarket wants to know how many customers are active shoppers. This is done to find out how much the level of customer loyalty is to shop at the company and how much the company can provide discounts or other benefits to loyal customers shopping at the company.

Companies want to know how much customer loyalty there is to shopping at their supermarket and what types of groceries are often purchased. This can help companies focus on customers who shop more often at their supermarkets by providing discounts and focusing on what types of groceries are purchased most often so that companies can reduce stock purchases of types of groceries that are rarely purchased.

As a data analyst, we will try to answer the following questions:

1. What are the characteristics of customers who frequently make purchases?
2. What are the characteristics of customers who shop when there is a promotion?
3. What types of groceries do customers often buy?
4. In what campaign are the most followed?

The results of this analysis aim to make decisions about what kind of customers will receive more campaign advertisements, what stock items should be added or reduced, and what strategies should be taken for the next campaign.
